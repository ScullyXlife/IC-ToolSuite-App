## Summary
IC ToolSuite is a standalone app. We do not run analytics, do not sell user data, and do not use advertising identifiers.

## What the app stores (on your device)
The app stores local configuration on your device, such as tokens/settings you choose to save. This data remains local unless you explicitly perform upload/sync actions.

## What the app sends over the network
The app only sends network requests needed for features you use, such as Nitrado operations, update checks, and optional account actions.

## What the app does NOT access
- No browser history or browser saved passwords
- No keystroke logging
- No Discord account data
- No files outside the locations you explicitly browse/select for import/export/upload

## What we do NOT collect
- No analytics/telemetry
- No advertising identifiers
- No sale of user data

## Account data handling (auth service)
Account features (registration/sign-in/session/device linking) use the project auth service over HTTPS.

## Your control
You can remove stored data at any time by clearing the app’s local storage/app data and by removing any saved Nitrado tokens from the app.

## Contact
For questions, open an issue on the project’s public releases repository (if available) or reach out via the support Discord.
