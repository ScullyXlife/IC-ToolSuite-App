## Summary
IC ToolSuite is a standalone desktop app. We do not run analytics, do not collect personal data, and do not sell or share user data.

This app does not require or operate a custom backend server.

## What the app stores (on your device)
The app stores configuration on your computer (for example via local app storage). This can include:
- Nitrado connection details you provide (such as API token and/or FTP settings)
- Selected Nitrado service id, platform selection, editor preferences, and tool settings

This data stays on your device unless you choose to upload configuration files to your Nitrado server.

## What the app sends over the network
The app only makes network requests to:
- Nitrado services you connect to (API calls and file upload/download actions you initiate)
- GitHub (only for updater/release checks, if enabled in the app build/workflow)

We do not operate a separate backend server for this app.

## What the app does NOT access
- No browser history or browser saved passwords
- No keystroke logging
- No Discord account data
- No files outside the locations you explicitly browse/select for import/export/upload

## What we do NOT collect
- No analytics/telemetry
- No advertising identifiers
- No sale of user data

## Your control
You can remove stored data at any time by clearing the app’s local storage/app data and by removing any saved Nitrado tokens from the app.

## Contact
For questions, open an issue on the project’s public releases repository (if available) or reach out via the support Discord.
